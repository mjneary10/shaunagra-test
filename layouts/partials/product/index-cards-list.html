         <h2 class="center">Personalised Home Cards</h2>
         <p>I love making New House Cards for couples with a twist.  So I use the Irish language and put “Teach Nua” on my cards.  I also use 3d embellishments too as it makes them extra special than just a printed card.  My housewarming cards are suitable for young couples or a family moving in to their first house or trading up.  I use cute little wooden houses on my cards or wooden keys either.  I also personalise these cards too with the first name or family name and the month they moved in to their new house.</p>

         <p>One of my favourite items to make are my unique Irish Engagements cards.  My designs are unique to the designs that are out there as I use cute little embellishments to give them a three dimensional effect.  To go that extra mile too I can include beautiful white ribbon too.  My handmade engagement cards are perfect for that special momnet in time.  My LGBT cards are actual some of my best selling cards too!  A small selection is up on my website but I will be continually adding more of my cards over the next few months.</p>
