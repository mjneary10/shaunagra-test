Are you looking for a special handmade condolence card to give to a loved one that has had a bereavement in the family? I have a number of handmade bereavement cards suitable for the loss of a mother, father, sister, brother or general bereavement. My personalised sympathy cards also include for the loss of a fur baby, either the death of a dog or a cat. These are the perfect keepsake card to show someone you are thinking about them during a very difficult time. After all, actions speak louder than words, and it would be a little comfort to know someone went to the trouble of sending such a special card.
