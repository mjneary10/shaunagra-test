Welcome to our personalised handmade cards page. We can design and create customised cards for all occasions. I am particularly drawn to making extra special Engagement Cards, Wedding Cards and Baby Cards. I also make birthday cards, pet loss cards too, you name it, we can create it. The beauty of my cards is that I can translate them for you in to the Irish Language if you require. So, if you are looking for something extra special, please contact me. I am concious of the beautiful island we live on so I try as much as possible to use recycled card, and reuse bubble wrap and cardboard too! This is saving our planet and also saving my customers pockets too on cutting down on useless waste.
