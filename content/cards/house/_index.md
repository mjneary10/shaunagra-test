I love making New House Cards for couples with a twist.  So I use the Irish language and put “Teach Nua” on my cards.  I also use 3d embellishments too as it makes them extra special than just a printed card.  My housewarming cards are suitable for young couples or a family moving in to their first house or trading up.  I use cute little wooden houses on my cards or wooden keys either.  I also personalise these cards too with the first name or family name and the month they moved in to their new house.
