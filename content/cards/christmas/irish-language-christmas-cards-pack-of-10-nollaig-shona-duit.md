Check out this cute and funny Irish Language Christmas Cards pack. They are perfect to send to loved ones Across the Miles. You can purchase these Nollaig Shona Duit cards in a pack of 10 we also offer a pack of 5. These Nollaig Shona Duit Carta as gaelige are a fun way to wish a Merry Christmas to your family and friends. Handmade in Ireland too. The text at the top of my card reads (Merry Christmas) in the English Language or (Nollaig Shona Duit) in the Irish Language. The middle of my design has your best friend with their nose stuck through a Christmas Wreath. For the background I have used some green Christmas stars. Underneath I have the wording (Love from the Murphy Family). The name can be changed to your Family Surname. These cards are perfect to send to loved ones abroad. Please let me know the name you would like to include on the cards.

You can choose from the Irish or English Language.
