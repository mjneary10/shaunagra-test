This is an exclusively designed and handmade personalised baby card by Shauna Grá that is made in the Irish Language. This keepsake baby card is perfect for the new arrival of your granddaughter, grandson, niece, nephew or a speical baby and has a rocking horse theme. The wording has “Fáilte roimh on domhan” which means “Welcome to the World” in the English Language. The main image has a rocking horse cut out of heavy quality cardstock in a pink or blue patterened design. I have put a cute little cream heart on their body to represent a saddle and there are silver gems on either side of their two hooves. It then has the baby's first name on it in an elegant pink or blue font. Lastly it has the baby's date of birth. The font is pink or blue depending on which version you choose.

It is print on a 6 x 6 inch white scallop edge card on 3 sides. This comes with a matching envelope of 100gsm. It also has 3 rustic heart embellishments on three of the corners and the final bottom right hand corner has a little button with handmae with love on it.
