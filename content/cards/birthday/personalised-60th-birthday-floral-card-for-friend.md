An elegant and custom 60th Birthday card for your best friend or a special woman in your life which is handmade in Ireland. This female 60th birthday card is suitable for your best friend who is 60 years old. It is personalised with their name. There are 4 floral birthday card designs to choose from. The text reads “To a Special Friend (personalised with name)” then in the middle of all of my designs I have a large number 60. Option A has “Happy Birthday” over the large number and at the bottom it reads “Friends for life you know too much”. All of the other designs have “Happy Birthday” at the bottom.
You may like to choose the scallop edge version to make it that extra special of a keepsake 60th birthday card for your best friend.
I can also change the wording to Mam, Mom or Nana if you would prefer. Just include in your message when ordering.
