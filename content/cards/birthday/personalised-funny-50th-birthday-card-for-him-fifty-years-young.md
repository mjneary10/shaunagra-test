Celebrate his milestone birthday with a perfect blend of humor and sophistication! This stylish yet funny 50th birthday Irish made card features "Happy Birthday (Person’s First Name), Fifty Years Young" in an elegant gold font, making sure he feels as special as he is—while also reminding him that age is just a number (or at least that’s what we tell ourselves!).

To add a personalised touch, this card includes four hilarious phrases to choose from, so you can pick the one that fits his personality best:

A) "They say wisdom comes with age… you must be the wisest person I know!" (For the one who likes to think he’s a fountain of knowledge—whether true or not!)\
B) "At 50, you've seen it all, done it all... but can’t remember most of it!" (Perfect for the guy who’s always misplacing his glasses—when they’re on his head!)\
C) "50 years of wisdom… and still no one listens to you!" (For the dad, uncle, or friend who loves to give advice—whether anyone asked or not!)\
D) "You’re 50! If life begins at 40, you’re now a decade into a midlife crisis!" (Ideal for the one who suddenly wants a sports car or a motorcycle!)

Printed on premium-quality cardstock, this card is the perfect mix of classy and comical, making it a fantastic choice for celebrating his big 5-0. Whether he's embracing the golden years or still in denial, this card will guarantee a good laugh!
