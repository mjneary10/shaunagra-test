A special and unique 80th Birthay card for your mam, aunt or nana that is personalised and designed in Ireland. This is a funny 80th Birthday card because it has an elderly woman on the front. There are 4 design options to choose from. Options A and B are of the same woman doing a fun pose. Option C is of an elegant elderly woman with a stick wearing a shirt and trousers and Option D is of an older woman holding a cute flower wearing a shirt and skirt. All designs read “Happy Birthday Mum”. They all have a large number 80 on the front with the word “today” underneath. Lastly the card has the date of birth of the woman at the bottom.  
The title of the woman can be changed too to suit who it is for! Please include in your message when ordering.
