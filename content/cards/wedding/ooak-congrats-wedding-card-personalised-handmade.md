description = "A unique and One of a Kind Irish made Wedding Card that is personalised.  This brown kraft Congrats on your wedding day card is completely different to the normal white or cream wedding card that a couple may receive.  It has Congratulations at the top with Mr & Mrs (Surname required) in an elegant black font.  The middle of my design has a gold leaf embellishment with little white resin flowers on it.  Underneath this 3d arrangement, it has the words (on your wedding day).  Lastly, it has the date of the wedding, personalised to the couple's wedding date.  This card is also available in a white version too if you prefer.  Click here to buy!"
