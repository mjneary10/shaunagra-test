One of my favourite items to make are my unique personalised handmade wedding cards. My designs are unique to the designs that are out there as I use cute little embellishments to give them a three dimensional effect. I also make personalised gay wedding cards, and Irish wedding cards. To go that extra mile too I can include beautiful white ribbon. My handmade Irish wedding cards are perfect for civil ceremonies, as a gay wedding day card or a lesbian wedding card. My LGBT cards are actual some of my best selling cards too! A small selection is up on my website but I will be continually adding more of my cards over the next few months. If you have seen one of my designs on Etsy and would like to purchase through my website, please get in touch and I can organise this for you."
