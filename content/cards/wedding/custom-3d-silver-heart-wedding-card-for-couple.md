Customised Wedding Card for your Daughter or Son with Silver Heart embellishment in the centre

Introducing our Customised Wedding Cardâ€”an elegant and timeless keepsake to commemorate your special day. At the top of my card it has, Congratulations. Then this stunning card features your son or daughters first name at the top complete with their soon to be wife or husband's name.

In the center, a delicate cut-out silver heart adds a touch of romance, while a hand-painted wooden embellishment in silver elevates the design with its artisanal charm.

For a unique touch, choose from four distinct corner embellishment options, allowing you to tailor the card to your personal style. The bottom of the card is reserved for your wedding date, perfectly framing your celebration in love and joy.

Printed on premium 300gsm cardstock, this card not only feels luxurious but is also designed to last. The unique scalloped edges on three sides add an extra layer of sophistication, making it stand out from traditional designs.
