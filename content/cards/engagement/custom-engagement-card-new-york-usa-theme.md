card is perfect for commemorating a couple's engagement in one of the world's most iconic cities.

Front Design: The front of the card features a stunning illustration of the New York City skyline,
including landmarks like the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, all beautifully silhouetted

There are four design options to choose from also!

Inside Message: The inside of the card is blank, allowing you to pen a heartfelt message. The card is
printed on high-quality, matte-finish cardstock, ensuring that it feels as luxurious as the occasion it
