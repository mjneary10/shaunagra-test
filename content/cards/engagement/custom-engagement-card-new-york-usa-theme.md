Celebrate love and the unforgettable magic of New York City with our custom "Congrats on Your
Engagement" card. This keepsake engagement card is perfect for your daughter, son, granddaughter,
grandson, niece or nephew. Designed and handmade in Ireland to capture the spirit of the Big Apple, this
card is perfect for commemorating a couple's engagement in one of the world's most iconic cities.

Front Design: The front of the card features a stunning illustration of the New York City skyline,
including landmarks like the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, all beautifully silhouetted
against a twilight sky. The words "Congratulations on Your Engagement" are elegantly scripted across the
top, with an option to add the couple's names and the date of their engagement for a personal touch.
There are four design options to choose from also!

Inside Message: The inside of the card is blank, allowing you to pen a heartfelt message. The card is
printed on high-quality, matte-finish cardstock, ensuring that it feels as luxurious as the occasion it
celebrates. There are two types of cards to choose from too. Plain white, 250gsm or White scallop edge
which is 300gsm. Both cards come with an envelope 100gsm.

romantic stroll through Times Square, this card is the perfect keepsake to mark the beginning of a
beautiful journey together in the city that never sleeps.
