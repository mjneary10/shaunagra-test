description = "My name is Michelle and I started making frames for family and friends as a hobby back in 2017. The story behind how we started. We attended three weddings in September 2017 and gave each couple a personalised wedding frame. The first one I made for my brother-in-law, another one for our neighbours and the last one for a close friend, they were delighted with the frames. In fact, when I gave one to my friend, she began to cry she was so pleased. Before we knew what hit us, we had our first order from her sister for two gift frames. To date, most of our orders come from repeat customers. We have made over 350+ frames so far and the number is growing speedily. We export our handcrafted gifts as far away as Canada and the USA. People keep coming back for more, thatâ€™s a good thing. Since then I have moved on to making frames and cards that match my frames."
