Please see the following customer product reviews, customer satisfaction is very important to us.  Our customers have purchased many products from us, and we are very grateful for their continued support over the last 12 months.  In order to promote good customer satisfaction I create my designs to a very high standard.  I try and source my frames through Irish suppliers too! 

Our customers have complimented us on our designs on both our frames and cards.  I love creating a frame for a special occasion and then designing a card that will match the frame!  It makes it extra special for the receiver too.

We always try to respond to enquiries as soon as possible.  I aim to respond to any emailed query as soon as possible.  When you place an order you will receive a confirmation email telling you the details about your order.  If for some reason I do not have the exact same items as shown on my website I will provide you with a mock up/mock ups to show you what I do have.  If you are not 100% entirely satisified I will refund you your money in full.  Every order processed is 100% made by me therefore please allow 5 to 7 working days for your order to be dispatched.  During seasonal occasions your order may take slightly longer 10 â€“ 12 working days.  We have many shipping options available also, standard post and registered post, all worldwide. We cater for all craft custom requests, and we try our best to fulfil all orders. We have created gifts for (families, weddings, birthdays, pets, communions, christenings, new babies, Irish gifts, memorial, kids zoo trips, first day at school) and many more.
