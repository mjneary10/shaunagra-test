Please see the following customer product reviews, customer satisfaction is very important to us. Our customers have purchased many products from us, and we are very grateful for their support over the last 12 months. In order to promote good customer satisfaction we create our craft gifts to a high standard. We use special tools in the crafting process to align and secure embellishments. We also, on a regular basis, check our competitors crafting processes and see how we can improve ours. There is nothing worse than paying for something then it falling apart when it arrives. Or worse, the person you gave it to lets you know it is in bits.

Our customers have complimented us on our designs on both our frames and cards. We always try to respond to enquiries as soon as possible, so that you are not kept waiting and receive your order fast. We have many shipping options available also, standard post and registered post, all worldwide. We cater for all craft custom requests, and we try our best to fulfil all orders. We have created gifts for (families, weddings, birthdays, pets, communions, christenings, new babies, Irish gifts, memorial, kids zoo trips, first day at school) and many more.
