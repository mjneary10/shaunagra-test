This bespoke gift may be ideal for a new house gift, wedding gift or blended family gift as this particular design can hold up to 6 names.

The family surname is at the very top of my design using wooden tiles and finished off with a little rustic heart at either end. The background is cream with a silver sublte sparkle. The heart shapes are cut out and the family first names are printed and stuck on to the hearts. Each first name has a little pear effect embellishment stuck at the top too. All of the hearts are placed on a beautiful wooden tree which is hand stained using a tea bag! On some of the branches of the tree I have included beautiful white floral embellishments. At the trunk of the tree I have included a gold ribbon and undernath it has a little cream heart with a rustic heart stuck on top. The very bottom of my design I have the word “Family” as an embellishment. This has a little rustic heart on either side. Lastly in right hand bottom corner I have a handmade button.

You can choose to have a different colour scheme too if you desire. Please include this in your message at the time of ordering.

Your fur babies can also be included in this frame, I can pop a little bone beside their name instead of a heart.

Please get in touch if you have any questions!
