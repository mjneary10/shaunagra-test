A modern Family Wall Art frame containing the first names of all the family. This is an ideal gift for a special birthday or anniversary gift.

I have used wooden tiles to spell out the first names of each family member. You can choose from two options. The first one is the option of 25 wooden tiles (approx. 5 short names) or the second option is up to 40 wooden tiles (approx. 8 names). Please note the frame is only 10 inches x 10 inches so I may have to do a mock up to make sure all the names fit. This will be provided after your order is placed.

The background is black with a silver effect design which shimmers in the light. The wooden tiles really stand out on this background. I have used rustic hearts on the top of some of the names and the end of the name. In the top right hand corner I have two cream wooden hearts with a rustic heart in the middle.

Bottom right hand corner has a handmade button to showcase this special family frame gift is handmade in Ireland.

You may also like to add in a customised card with your order. This will match the occasion you require this frame for. Just let me know what it is at the time of ordering.

If anything is unclear please get in touch and I will be happy to clarify things for you.
