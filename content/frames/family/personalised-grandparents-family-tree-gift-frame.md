Celebrate the heart of your family with our personalised grandparents Frame, a timeless tribute to the love and joy that grandparents bring. Frame is crafted with care and handmade in Ireland This custom grandparents family tree gift frame is more than just a display—it's a cherished keepsake that encapsulates the unique bond shared across generations.

You can personalise this meaningful grandparents present with the first names of each grandchild, creating a truly bespoke masterpiece that captures the essence of your family tree. I have used wooden tiles to display the surname in this grandchildren names frame with a little rustic heart on either side of it. It has a little wooden tree as the main piece which is handpainted using silver acrylic paint.

The names are printed on to 300gsm acid free cardstock. I have glued the names on to cute little wooden hearts and filed them down to fit. They are adorned with white pearl embellishments. You can choose a preferred background colour to complement the decor of the grandparents. In this case I have used an elegant lavender backdrop with little lavender hearts. Underneath the tree it has the word Grandparent which is broken up to fit and it also has little rustic hearts on either side to match the top wooden tiles. So the recievers know this is a truly special gift it has a little handmade button on it.

This thoughtful customised Grandparents keepsake present is a perfect blend of elegance and sentiment. From family gatherings to special occasions, let this Grandkids name frame be the backdrop to the beautiful memories you've created together. Give the gift of love and nostalgia with our Personalised and cherised Grandparents keepsake frame, a heartfelt expression that speaks volumes about the enduring connections that make your family truly extraordinary.

You can add in a personalised card to go with your personalised grandparents keepsake frame, please choose frame & card package when ordering.
