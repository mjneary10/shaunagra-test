Are you looking for a unique wedding gift for a blended family. Have a look at this customised family gift frame as the perfect gift for two families merging as one. This is a one of a kind gift for a wedding or anniversary, check out this custom Family frame made up using wooden tiles. The main background for this family wall art is blue with white and red decorative hearts.

The first names of each family member are all spelt out using wooden tiles and interlinked so it looks like a crossword puzzle. You can choose from two options. The first one is the option of 25 wooden tiles (approx. 5 short names) or the second option is up to 40 wooden tiles (approx. 8 names). Please note the frame is only 10 inches x 10 inches so I may have to do a mock up to make sure all the names fit. This will be provided after your order is placed.

At the top and bottom of some of the names I have finished them off using a little rustic heart. In the top right hand corner I have used two cream wooden hearts divided by a little rustic heart in the middle. The bottom right hand corner has a handmade button to show how truly special this gift is.

Why not add in a customised card with your order for your personalised family name frame and I can make it to go with your name frame depending on what the occasion is for. Any questions don't be afraid to get in touch by email and I will assist you.

Specifications are: -

10 x 10 inches

Real glass frontage.

Hook on the back for wall hanging.
