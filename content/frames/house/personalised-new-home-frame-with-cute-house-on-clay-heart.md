This personalised new home frame is sold exclusively by Shauna Grá. It is the perfect housewarming frame to give to your daughter, son, granddaughter, grandson, niece, nephew or best friend moving into their forever home. The background is made up of a black and silver background which shimmers in the light. I have used 4 cute and dainty mirrors in three of the four corners. In the bottom right-hand corner, I have also included a little handmade wooden button. The main part of my design has the couples first names at the top, with the words “New House”. It is printed on a 300gsm white cardstock. In the middle of this housewarming gift, I have used a handmade clay heart which has a delicate texture printed on to it. Then I have glued a little wooden house in the middle. Underneath the main feature I have included the date the couple moved in.

If you would like to add in a personalised new house card, please add this in your basket at the time of ordering. Your card will be personalised with the couples first names, the event it is for and the date. You can choose to have your card printed on a plain white card (250gsm) with matching envelope OR white scallop edge card on 3 sides (300gsm) complete with envelope.

If you like the idea of this frame but the colour does not suit the couple it is for the background can be changed to something else. Just include in your message at the time of purchase.

If anything is unclear please get in touch and I will be happy to clarify things for you.
