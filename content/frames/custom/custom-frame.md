Are you looking to have a special personalised frame made for a special occasion well look no further than Shauna Grá.
I can make a bespoke frame once I know the following:-

• Who is it for?

• What is the occasion? e.g. Birthday, Retirement, Moving abroad etc.

• What colour would you like for background?

• Are there any particular images / embellishments you would like on it?

You can choose to have your customised made-to-order frame made up of wooden tiles, a print or a combination of both.

I have made several unique frames over the years and proud to say they are hanging up in all corners of the globe too! Check out a selection of some of these in this listing.

Please note if you give me ideas for your frame I will provide you with two mock ups. Once you pick one of these designs we can then make necessary alterations / amendments. However if you change the design completly I will charge an extra €25 for a new design.

I can make a special personalised card to go with your bespoke frame too! Just include at the time of ordering using the frame & card package options when ordering.
Your gift can be sent directly to your loved one too. Just include the message you want me to put on the inside and leave the rest to me. No prices will be included if it is for a gift. I will send you a photos of the final gift that I sent off and a photo of the card too.

Please note I do not print off photos to include in the design as sometimes the quality of photo provided may be of a low resolution (poor picture quality). I can leave space in design if you wish to include a photo by using little pegs making it easy for you to include a photo.

If you have any further queries please do not hesitate to get in touch.
