description = "Losing a loved one even if it is expected is always extremely hard. Are you looking to have a special memorial frame made to give to a loved one or friend. Please contact me to discuss your options. I have made frames for baby loss, a bereavement of a husband & wife, to name a few. I can also cater for the loss of a pet. As this is such a hard time on a family, I do not post these particular frames up on my website or social media. To give you some ideas though, I have numerous embellishments suitable to use for such occasions e.g. Feathers, angel wings, pet paws, bones. I also do sympathy cards. You can have a look at my website for some of my general card designs."
