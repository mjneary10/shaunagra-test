description = "Losing a loved one even if it is expected is always extremely hard. Are you looking to have a special memorial frame made to give to a loved one or friend. Please contact me to discuss your options. I have made frames for baby loss, a bereavement of a husband & wife, to name a few. I can also cater for the loss of a pet."

Loosing a loved one can be an extremely challenging time in someone's life. If you would like to organise a custom memorial frame which is handmade in Dublin, Ireland to honour and loved one that has passed please get in touch. I have made numerous personalised remembrance frames over the years. Out of respect for the families involved and as it is such a delicate and personal time, I do not put these frames up on my website. I have made bereavement frames for miscarriages, death of a loved one, death of fur babies to mention a few. In your sympathy frame you can choose to have (1) wooden tiles (2) printed version or (3) combination of both. A recent keepsake frame that I made included a beautiful, printed robin which I hand painted in similar colours to make the design really stand out. I also handmade a personalised card to match. If you would like a Celtic cross symbol included in a memorial frame do not hesitate to get in touch either.

I have vast selection of embellishments including religious crosses, butterflies, robins, feathers, cat embellishments, dog embellishments which are all suitable to include in this type of custom memorial frame.
Note: I do not print out photos to include in my design, however I can leave a space to accommodate a photo of a loved one by including little pegs to attach at a later date.

Please add to your basket a handmade card if you would like me to make you one of a similar design to match your frame. I can also send this type of gift to a loved one direct and rest assured I never include prices in my packaging.

If anything is unclear please get in touch and I will be happy to clarify things for you.
