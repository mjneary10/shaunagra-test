Are you looking for a unique and personalised wedding gift frame or token wedding gift for your best friend, daughter, son, niece, nephew or a special couples big day that is handmade in Ireland? Look at this one-of-a-kind custom wedding frame! At the top of this bespoke wedding frame, it has the couples first names above a printed elegant rose arch. It is decorated with floral and gem embellishments with two little pearl effect gems at the foot of the arch. Underneath I have the couple cut out in heavy duty gold cardstock. Underneath the couple it has the words “Wedding Day” in an elegant black font. Then underneath that again it has the date of the happy event. In four of the corners of the frame I have used a pear effect gem.
Did you know that you can order a handmade personalised wedding card to go with your frame? Just add it to your basket / cart at the time of ordering. There are two types of cards to choose from. You can choose the plain white version which is 250gsm (no embellishments) or the 300gsm version. This type has the 3 rustic heart buttons in three of the corners and the bottom right has a handmade button.

This personalized wedding décor gift is exclusive to Shauna Grá so you can be assured the couple will not receive several of these. It is the perfect wedding present to give to a couple as a wedding token gift and to include if you wanted to give them a voucher too!
I can easily adapt this design for a gay wedding frame too, please get in touch to discuss.
