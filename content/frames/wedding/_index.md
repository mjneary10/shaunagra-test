Our wedding gift frames could be used as a gift for the bride or groom from the proud parents.  Our gift frames can be changed accordingly to suit the style of the happy couple.  Most of our frames are sourced in Ireland too, and some are even handmade in a factory in Cork!  

If you are looking for an unusual keepsake for a couple recently engaged why not choose one of my personalised engagement gift frames.  I can use wooden tiles to incorporate their first names, wooden numbers to include the date of the happy event.  That all important ring can also be included using an elegant wooden embellishment.  I can even include room for a photo if you would like to include one.  If you prefer I can do an engagement print or combine print with wooden tiles.  Contact me for more details.
