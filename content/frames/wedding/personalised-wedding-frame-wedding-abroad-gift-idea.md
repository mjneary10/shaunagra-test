This personalised wedding frame is perfectly suited to give to your son, nephew, niece or daughter or any couple that is travelling to get married abroad. The main background has a vibrant green leaf tropical border printed on 160gsm A3 quality white paper. The bride and groom are cut out of gold heavy duty cardstock and framed in a gold circular frame. The bride has little gems in her hair. The couple are leaning into one another, and it has a silhouette of their heads. The top of my frame has the happy coupleâ€™s first names on a little green banner, their names are in an elegant white font. Underneath the happy couple I have the date of their nuptials on second green banner with the date of the wedding in white. In the four corners I have a pear effect embellishment.

I have a Mr & Mrs Tropical Wedding Card to match this personalised Mr & Mrs Wedding frame which has the first names of the couple and the date of their up-and-coming wedding. It has the same tropical leaf border as the frame. There are two types of cards to choose from. You can choose the plain white version which is 250gsm (no embellishments) or the 300gsm version. This type has the 3 rustic heart buttons in three of the corners and the bottom right has a handmade button. Please add the frame & card package to your cart if you would like to include the card to match.

Specifications are: -

10 x 10 inches

Real glass frontage.

Hook on the back for wall hanging.
