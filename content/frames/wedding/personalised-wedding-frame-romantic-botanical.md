A beautiful and elegant personalised wedding frame décor piece designed for your daughter or sons big day! This Bride and Groom frame background has a romantic and botanical theme with elegant pink flowers and green leaves in front of an arch glass window. The flowers are decorated with subtle gems. The main feature of this custom wedding frame is an elegant Bride and Groom cut out using heavy silver glitter cardstock. The happy wedding couple are raised up from the printed background too. They are holding hands, and the bride is holding a bouquet of flowers in her other hand. They are decorated with subtle gems. The couple’s first names have a 3d effect with their first names printed on a green banner in a white font. The date of the wedding at the bottom is on a smaller green banner and white font is used. Each corner of the frame has a pear effect button on it.

We can also provide a matching personalised wedding card to match this frame. There are two types of cards to choose from. You can choose the plain white version which is 250gsm (no embellishments) or the 300gsm version. This type has the 3 rustic heart buttons in three of the corners and the bottom right has a handmade button. Please note on both types of cards the couple is printed on. Please add the frame & card package to your cart if you would like to include the card to match.
