This bespoke customised wedding frame gift is made up of wooden tiles to spell out the Bride and Groom’s first names. It’s the perfect keepsake wedding gift to give to your daughter, son, granddaughter, grandson, niece or nephew for their wedding day. Underneath the first names I have two cute hand painted silver butterflies. The middle of my design I have a hand painted silver acrylic tree. The happy couple are hand cut out of foam and spray-painted silver. The bride has silver gems on the skirt part of her dress. On either side of the tree, I have added hand painted silver bird cages. Underneath the happy couple I have the date of their wedding made up using rustic cream hearts with wooden numbers glued on to them. To divide the date up I have used 2 cute rustic hearts. At the bottom of my design, I have the words “wedding day” spelt out using wooden tiles. . (Please note that the background shown will be slightly different in your frame).
