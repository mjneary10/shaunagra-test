This personalised wedding frame has a romantic tone about it and is perfect to give to your best friend, daughter or niece on their wedding day. I have used roses, carnations and white flowers in it too. The top of my frame has the bride and groom’s first names on a 3d effect banner. Their names are printed on an elegant white font. On either side of their names, I have placed a little silver gem.
The main design has a wooden arch surrounded by delicate pink & white romantic floral arrangements on 2 levels. The couple are leaning in for a kiss and they are cut out on gold heavy cardstock. Over the couples heads I have the word “Wedding Day” on a little green banner and the word is printed out in white. The bride has a little gem in her hair too. The date of the happy event is at the end of my design on a smaller green banner, and it’s printed using an elegant white font. I have placed a little white effect pearl button on either side. Lastly in the four corners I have used an elegant white pearl effect button with a decorative edge.

You may also like to consider saving yourself time and money by ordering the matching personalised wedding card. There are two types of cards to choose from. You can choose the plain white version which is 250gsm (no embellishments) or the 300gsm version. This type has the 3 rustic heart buttons in three of the corners and the bottom right has a handmade button. Please note on both types of cards the couple is printed on. Please add the frame & card package to your cart if you would like to include the card to match.
