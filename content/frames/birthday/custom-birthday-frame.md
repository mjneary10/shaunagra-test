Are you looking for a personalised birthday frame for a loved one that is handmade in Ireland? Check out this custom birthday frame listing.

I can make an extra special personalised birthday gift for a loved one, relative or friend. You can choose to have your customised birthday frame made up of wooden tiles, a print or a combination of both.

I have made several age frames from 18 up to 100 too! Check out a selection of some of these in this listing.

When ordering your unique birthday personalised frame, just let me know the following:-

• Who is it for?

• What age are they?

• What are there hobbies / interests?

• What colour would you like for background?

• Are there any particular images / embellishments you would like on it?

• Do you want their age included? And if so using wooden numbers.

Please note if you give me ideas for your frame I will provide you with two mock ups. Once you pick one of these designs we can then make necessary alterations / amendments. However if you change the design completly I will charge an extra €25 for a new design.

I also offer a personalised birthday frame with name and customised handmade card package for this occasion too. Which means their birthday card can match their frame.

Your gift can be sent directly to them if you like. Just include the message you want me to put on the inside and leave the rest to me. No prices will be included if it is for a gift.

Please note I do not print off photos to include in the design as sometimes the quality of photo provided may be of a low resolution (poor picture quality). I can leave space in design if you wish to include a photo by using little pegs making it easy for you to include a photo.

If you have any further queries please do not hesitate to get in touch.
