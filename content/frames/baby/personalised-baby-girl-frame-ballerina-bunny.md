Are you looking for a personalised baby girl frame with a rabbit or ballerina bunny on it as special
nursery decor for your daughter's bedroom. This would also make a wonderful gift for your
grandduaghter's bedroom, niece's nursery or a special Goddaughter? Check out my Handmade
Personalised Baby Girl Frame with the sweetest and cutest Ballerina Bunny. This baby girl's name
frame is made up using wooden tiles.

Celebrate the arrival of your precious little one with this adorable custom baby girl frame, crafted to
create a lasting keepsake. The centrepiece features a pink stage with spotlights. In the middle of my
design it has a delightful watercolour ballerina bunny—a soft, whimsical character dancing gracefully in
her tutu, symbolizing innocence and charm. To make it extra special I have sewn on a pink ribbon and
some tull to the bunny's skirt. I have raised the stage and the ballerina bunny using foam squares. It is
glued on top of a cream sparkle background.

In the top left, right and bottom left corners I have added 3d flowers that are carefully handmade by me
using a few layrers of pretty pink and white cardstock. In the centre of each flower there is a special little
pink gem. Please note the flowers used in your frame may be slightly different to the ones used.

Surrounding the bunny's head are wooden tiles spelling out your baby girl's name, carefully arranged to
bring a touch of rustic elegance. I have also added some pearl embellishments to the pink stage. At the
bottom of the stage I have added some handcrafted wooden numbers display her date of birth, making
this a truly bespoke gift for your daughter's room, or first time new parents for their girl's nursery. Finally
in the bottom right hand corer it has a wooden “handmade button” showing how truly special this one of a
kind piece is.

This beautifully detailed frame captures your baby girl's special moment, blending warmth, artistry, and
timeless personalization into one unique piece. Perfect for baby showers, christenings, or as a cherished
keepsake.
