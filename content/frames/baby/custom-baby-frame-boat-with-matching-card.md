Introducing our Personalised Baby Boy Sailboat Frame—the perfect keepsake to celebrate the arrival of
your little sailor! This custom frame is the perfect keepsake present for your grandson, nephew or a
special little boy in your life This frame is more than just a decoration; it's a treasured memory captured
in art, perfect for celebrating the arrival of a little one. Whether you're gifting it to new parents or adding
it to your own nursery, the Personalised Baby Boy Sailboat Frame is sure to become a cherished keepsake.
This charming nautical frame features a beautifully crafted wooden sailboat as the centerpiece. The
printed background has a vibrant blue sky and bright orange sun with a colourful orange beach. The
sailboat is hand-painted in soothing shades of blue and white with premium acrylic paints. On the sail of
the boat I have placed orange buttons to pick up the colours in the background. I have also glued on a
little sailors wheel.

Your baby boy’s name takes pride of place at the top of the frame, adding a touch of personalisation that
makes this piece truly special. On either side of your little boy's name I have included a blue wooden
heart. Then it has the main design. At the very bottom of the design it has the date of birth, flanked by
two adorable anchor buttons, adding a nautical charm that ties the whole design together.
The sailboat is set against a vibrant sea background, bringing the scene to life with rich, playful colors that
will brighten up any nursery. This frame is not just a decoration; it’s a cherished memory captured in a
unique and artistic way. Perfect as a gift or a personal keepsake, this frame is a beautiful reminder of your
baby boy’s first moments.

Lastly in the bottom right hand corner it has a handmade button to show how truly special this one of a
kind piece is!

Don't forget you can choose a special card to match this frame for the birth of the baby boy or their
christening date. Please include it when ordering and then let me get your order ready!
