+++

This personalised baby boy frame with a blue elephant is a unique gift frame for your son’s, grandson’s or nephew’s nursery. The top of this wooden tile frame has the baby boy’s name spelt out using the tiles. At either end of the name, I have used a cute little rustic heart button.
The background I have used is made up of simple blue hearts not to take away from the design. There are other options of background to choose from also. There is a hand painted silver tree in the middle of my design. To add to the sweetness of this design I have also used some cute little blue & white baby buttons on the tree. At the trunk of the tree, I have a super cute little foam baby blue elephant. To tie everything together I have used wooden numbers for the date of birth of the baby. Finally, it has a little handmade button on it.

Why not choose our baby boy or girl frame & card package too so your card will match the same theme as your frame, saving you time & money. The handmade baby card made to match this particular frame has a cute little grey elephant with a blue bow and he is sitting in front of a blue watercolour background. You can choose the card for proud new parents on the birth of their baby boy. If you prefer you can have the card made for the baby boy’s baptism, christening or naming ceremony date. This customised frame design can also be adapted for a girl if require. Please contact me if you would like a different colour scheme.
