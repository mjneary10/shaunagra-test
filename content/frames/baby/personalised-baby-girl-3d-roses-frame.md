This personalized baby girl frame is a beautifully handcrafted piece of art, perfect for celebrating a new arrival. This custom birth baby girl name frame features delicate, handmade flowers, each meticulously crafted from elegant pink and white floral-patterned and gold card stock, adding a touch of luxury and charm. No too frames are the same as the flowers are unique to the way they are cut on the patterned craft paper.

At the center of the frame, your baby girl's name is customized in an elegant pink script, surrounded by the floral embellishments. I have also added some gold leaves to give it an extra special touch. Beneath her name, her date of birth is displayed in a simple gray font, making it a keepsake to treasure forever.

Handmade in Ireland, this baby girl floral frame captures the essence of Irish craftsmanship and is a perfect gift for any nursery or home.

This frame design can be adapted for a little girl's Christening / Baptism day or Naming Ceremony day too!

Why not choose our baby girl frame & card package too, so your card will match the same theme as your frame, saving you time & money. The card to match this particular frame has a floral border if you choose the version for a new baby. The Christening / Baptism version has a floral border with an elegant cross on it. This customised frame design can also be adapted for a boy if required. Please contact me if you would like a different colour scheme.
