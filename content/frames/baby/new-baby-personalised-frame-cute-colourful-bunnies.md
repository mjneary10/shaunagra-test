A sweet, personalised newborn baby frame with a colourful field with colourful rabbits or bunnies. This customised gift frame is handmade in Ireland. It is perfect for your daughter’s, granddaughter’s, nieces, or a special little lady’s bedroom. The main design is a colourful field with beautiful blue skies and green fields. It has four little bunny rabbit embellishments in red, green, blue and yellow. The baby girl’s name is in a pink cloud and decorated with a fabric pink ribbon rose on either side. At the bottom of my design, it has the baby’s date of birth on it. It has 3 rustic heart buttons in three of the corners along with a handmade button in the final bottom right hand corner.

Why not choose our baby boy or girl frame & card package too so your card will match the same theme as your frame, saving you time & money. The card to match this particular frame has a pink tree on the front with a cute bunny standing in front. You can choose the personalised baby card for the birth of a baby girl or their baptism / christening date. This customised frame design can also be adapted for a boy if require. Please contact me if you would like a different colour scheme.
