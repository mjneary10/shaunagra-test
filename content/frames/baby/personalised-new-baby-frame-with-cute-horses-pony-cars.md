A colourful bright personalised frame suitable for your son’s nursery. This frame has a colourful field with colourful horses / ponies and cars on it as the theme. This customised gift frame is perfect for your grandson, son, nephew, or a special little boy’s bedroom. The main design is a colourful field with beautiful blue skies and green fields. It has three little colourful ponies on it and two little colourful cars. The baby boy’s name is in a white cloud and decorated with two little butterflies on either side. At the bottom of my design, it has the baby’s date of birth on it. It has 3 rustic heart buttons in three of the corners along with a handmade button in the final bottom right hand corner.

Why not choose our baby boy or girl frame & card package too so your card will match the same theme as your frame, saving you time & money. The personalised baby congratulations card that I can make to match this particular frame has a rocking horse standing in front of a blue watercolour background. You can choose the card for the birth of a baby boy and their proud parents. You may want to pick the card for their baptism / christening date instead. This customised frame design can also be adapted for a girl if require. Please contact me if you would like a different colour scheme.
