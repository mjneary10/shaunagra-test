This personalised unique baby girl’s frame with a pink elephant is the perfect personalised gift frame for your daughter, granddaughter or niece’s nursery. It is handmade in Ireland too! The top of this wooden tile frame has the baby girl’s name spelt out using the wooden tiles. At either end of the name, I have used a cute little rustic heart button.

The background I have used is made up of simple and modern pink circles not to take away from the design. There are other options of background to choose from also. There is a hand painted silver tree in the middle of my design. To add to the sweetness of this design I have also used some cute little pink & white baby buttons on the tree. At the trunk of the tree, I have a super cute little foam baby pink polka dot elephant. To tie everything together I have used wooden numbers for the date of birth of the baby. Finally, it has a little handmade button on it.

Why not choose our baby boy or girl frame & card package too so your card will match the same theme as your frame, saving you time & money. The custom baby card made to match this particular frame has a cute little grey elephant with a pink bow holding a pink balloon she is standing in front of a pink star background. You can choose the card for proud new parents on the birth of their baby girl. If you prefer you can have the card made for the baby girl’s baptism, christening or naming ceremony date. This customised frame design can also be adapted for a boy if require. Please contact me if you would like a different colour scheme.
