A beautiful new baby gift custom frame with a moon and star embellishment suitable for your daughter, granddaughter, niece, son, grandson or nephew’s nursery. This unique handmade in Ireland baby frame has a subtle pink or blue watercolour circle in the middle which has pearl effect and gems framing the circle. The baby’s name is in an elegant grey script font and the date of the birth is underneath in a smaller modern font. I have also added in a cute little wooden embellishment of a happy moon face & happy star face. In three of the corners, I have used 3 rustic heart buttons, and the bottom right-hand corner has a handmade button.

Why not choose our baby boy or girl frame & card package too so your card will match the same theme as your frame, saving you time & money. The personalised baby girl card to match this particular frame has a cute little elephant on the front sitting on a pink / blue half-moon. You can choose the card for the birth of a baby boy or their christening date. This customised frame design can also be adapted to another colour circle if require. Please contact me if you would like a different colour scheme.
