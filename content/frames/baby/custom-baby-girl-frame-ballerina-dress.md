Celebrate your little one’s arrival with our personalised baby girl frame featuring a charming pink
ballerina dress design. This elegant frame is the perfect way to capture those precious early memories,
combining sweetness with a touch of ballet-inspired magic.

At the top of my design the little girl's name is made up using wooden tiles. I have used handmade
crafted flowers in three of the corners. The bottom right has a handmade button showing how special this
gift is. The main focal point is the ballerina dress or tutu. I have printed this out using 300gsm quality
cardstock. I have also sewn a little pink ribbon in the middle holding tulle that forms part of the dress.
Lastly I have used wooden numbers for the date of birth.

This frame would make an elegant one of a kind custom baby gift for your daughter or son that had a
baby girl. This ballerina baby girl frame is Ideal for a nursery as it can be customized with your baby
girl's name and birth date making it a unique keepsake to cherish forever.
Crafted from high-quality materials and made in Ireland, this frame is not just a beautiful decoration but a
lasting reminder of your baby girl's first moments. It’s the perfect gift for new parents, baby showers, or
christenings!

Don't forget you can add a card to match this frame to your basket! Saving time & money too.
