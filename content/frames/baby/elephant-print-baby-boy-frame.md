This handmade custom baby girl frame has a silver and pink elephant perfect as a gift for your daughter, granddaughter, niece, or a little lady’s bedroom. It has the baby girl’s name in a pink & grey font at the top. In the middle it has the cutest hand painted elephant in silver acrylic paint with pink gems on her ears and feet. On either side of the elephant, I have a little heart rustic shaped button. Underneath I have included the baby’s date of birth, time of birth and weight. Finally in the bottom right corner it has a handmade button to show how special this personalised frame is for a baby girl.

Why not choose our baby girl or boy frame & card package too so your card will match the same theme as your frame, saving you time & money. You can choose the unique customised newborn card for the birth of a baby girl or their baptism date. This design can also be adapted to a boy version too using blue where I have pink. I keep the elephant just plain with no gems for the boy’s version too. Please contact me if you would like a different colour scheme.
