A beautiful and vibrant family Irish pebble art frame made for a family of four. This pebble artwork frame is handmade in Ireland and would be the perfect wedding token gift or blended family gift. It has four cute little pebbles representing the two parents and the two kids. I have painted the family members using gold & silver acrylic paint. They are placed on a printed background that includes trees and a blue sky. I have hand painted over the graphics using acrylic paint to make the trees and background really stand out. On the tress I have included little pink wooden butterflies. The top of my design has the word “Family” and then at the bottom it has the sentiment “forever for always no matter what”. Lastly it has a little handmade button in the corner.

I can also make a card to go with this frame, please consider asking this to your cart when ordering your special pebble art frame.
