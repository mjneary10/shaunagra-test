Unique Irish gifts for a loved one abroad. Céad Míle Fáilte means “one hundred thousand welcomes” and is a well-known Irish Blessing. Fáilte just means “welcome”. Please note; Customers can request a fada in the wording if they would prefer. I have left it off as the wooden tiles do not have a fada on them as this is in the Irish language. Customers generally purchase one of these wonderful handmade Irish signs for hanging in their hallway. They are a unique way of bringing a little piece of home in to your home if you are living away. So, if you are looking for authentic Irish decor, or the perfect Irish gift for him or her, please contact us.
