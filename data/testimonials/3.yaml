text: "Just got a frame for my friends birthday. Absolutely beautiful! So well made and beautifully finished. Lovely to deal with, so patient I didn't like the words I had picked originally and it was absolutely no problem to change, my order was completed very quickly. I opted to collect as live locally and they were so welcoming kind and pleasent to deal with. Highly recommend ðŸ˜Š"
