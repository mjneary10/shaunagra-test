text: "received my frame from Shauna the other day- it came much quicker than expected! i was so thrilled with both the quality and attention to detail the frame was- especially for the price! Shauna really did go above and beyond making it very special and unique and was an absolute pleasure to deal with. I am so happy i decided to shop Irish and support local. i will most definitely be shopping from Shauna again."
