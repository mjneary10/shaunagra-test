      <description>This personalised wedding frame has a romantic tone about it and is perfect to give to your best friend, daughter or niece on their wedding day. I have used roses, carnations and white flowers in it too. The top of my frame has the bride and groom’s first names on a 3d effect banner. Their names are printed on an elegant white font. On either side of their names, I have placed a little silver gem.</description>

      <description>This bespoke customised wedding frame gift is made up of wooden tiles to spell out the Bride and Groom’s first names. It’s the perfect keepsake wedding gift to give to your daughter, son, granddaughter, grandson, niece or nephew for their wedding day. Underneath the first names I have two cute hand painted silver butterflies. The middle of my design I have a hand painted silver acrylic tree. The happy couple are hand cut out of foam and spray-painted silver.</description>
