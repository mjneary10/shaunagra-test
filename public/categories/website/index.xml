      <description>We have finally upgraded our website. Why? to make it easier to update, faster, and more mobile and user-friendly. We have also updated our product list with many new designs for frames. We now sell cards also, and the famous frame and card package is still available (purchase a frame and upgrade to include a card that is personalised to suite the frame and occasion).</description>
